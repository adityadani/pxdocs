description: Find out how to pair your clusters and migrate Kubernetes resources between them

## Pairing clusters
In order to failover an application running on one Kubernetes cluster to another Kubernetes cluster, we need to migrate the resources between them.
On Kubernetes you will define a trust object required to communicate with the other Kubernetes cluster called a ClusterPair. This creates a pairing between the scheduler (Kubernetes) so all the Kubernetes resources, 
can be migrated between them. Throughout this section the notion of source and destination clusters apply only at the Kubernetes level and does not apply to Storage, as you have a single Portworx storage fabric running on both the clusters.
As Portworx is stretched across them, the volumes do not need to be migrated. 

For reference,

* **Source Cluster** is the Kubernetes cluster where your applications are running
* **Destination Cluster** is the Kubernetes cluster where the applications will be failed over, in case of a disaster in the source cluster.

In the generated **ClusterPair** spec, you will see an unpopulated *options* section. It expects options that are required to pair Storage. However as we have a single storage fabric this section is not needed.
You can delete the line `<insert_storage_options_here>` and proceed ahead.
Save this to a file called clusterpair.yaml on the source cluster.

#### Apply the generated ClusterPair on the source cluster

On the **source** cluster create the clusterpair by applying the generated spec.
```
$ kubectl apply -f clusterpair.yaml
clusterpair.stork.libopenstorage.org/remotecluster created
```

### Verify the Pair status
Once you apply the above spec on the source cluster you should be able to check the status of the pairing. On a successful pairing, you should
see the "Storage Status" and "Scheduler Status" as "Ready" using storkctl on the
source cluster:
```
$ storkctl get clusterpair
NAME               STORAGE-STATUS   SCHEDULER-STATUS   CREATED
remotecluster      NotProvided      Ready              09 Apr 19 18:16 PDT
```

## Migrating Resources
Once the pairing is configured, applications can now failover from one cluster to another. In order to achieve that we need to 
migrate the Kubernetes resources to the destination cluster

### Starting Migration

#### Using a spec file
In order to make the process schedulable and repeatable, you can write a YAML
specification. In that YAML, you will specify an object called a Migration.
In the specification, you will define the scope of the 
applications to move and decide whether to automatically start the applications.
Here, create a migration and save as migration.yaml.
```
apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
kind: Migration
metadata:
  name: mysqlmigration
  namespace: migrationnamespace
spec:
  # This should be the name of the cluster pair created above
  clusterPair: remotecluster
  # If set to false this will migrate only the Portworx volumes. No PVCs, apps, etc will be migrated
  includeResources: true
  # If set to false, the deployments and stateful set replicas will be set to 0 on the destination.
  # If set to true, the deployments and stateful sets will start running once the migration is done
  # There will be an annotation with "stork.openstorage.org/migrationReplicas" on the destinationto store the replica count from the source.
  startApplications: false
  # If set to false, the volumes will not be migrated
  includeVolumes: false
  # List of namespaces to migrate
  namespaces:
  - migrationnamespace
```

From the above Migration spec note:

* The option `includeVolumes` is set to false, because the volumes are already present on the destination cluster as there is a single storage fabric
* The option `startApplications` is set to false, so that the applications do not start when the resources are migrated. We want to start the applications on the destination cluster only when we want to failover the application.


You can now invoke or schedule the now defined migration. This step is automateable or can
be user invoked. In order to invoke from the command-line, run the following
steps:

```
kubectl apply -f migration.yaml
```

#### Using storkctl
You can also start a migration using storkctl:
```
$ storkctl create migration mysqlmigration --clusterPair remotecluster --namespaces migrationnamespace --includeResources -n migrationnamespace
Migration mysqlmigration created successfully
```

#### Migration scope
Currently you can only migrate namespaces in which the object is created. You
can also designate one namespace as an admin namepace. This will allow an admin
who has access to that namespace to migrate any namespace from the source
cluster. Instructions for setting this admin namespace to stork can be found
[here](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/migration/px-motion/cluster-admin-namespace)

### Monitoring Migration
Once the migration has been started using the above step, you can check the status of the migration using storkctl

The Stages of migration will go from Applicationâ†’Final if successful.
```
$ storkctl get migration -n migrationnamespace
NAME             CLUSTERPAIR     STAGE     STATUS       VOLUMES   RESOURCES   CREATED               ELAPSED
mysqlmigration   remotecluster   Final     Successful   0/0       9/9         09 Apr 19 19:45 PDT   19s
```

Until now, we have only migrated the Kubernetes resources to the destination cluster. However the replicas of the Application is set to 0, so that it does not start running. On the destination cluster
you can see the application deployment is created but it is not running.

```
# kubectl get deployments -n migrationnamespace
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
mysql     0         0         0            0           5m
```
